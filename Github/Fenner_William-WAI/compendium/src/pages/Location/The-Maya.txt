The Maya of the Forest

Landmarks: Immortal Lake, The Forest

A heavily forested area bordering the southern half of Stereve mountain. The Maya of the Forest has claimed plenty of victims due to mysterious circumstances, yet for some reason, the residents of Stereve village are capable of navigating the Maya perfectly.
Perhaps some unknown force willingly grants them protection?
