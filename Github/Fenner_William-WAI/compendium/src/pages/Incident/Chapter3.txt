*Part 1: Visage*

	It was slow initially but the number of jobs picked up and requested of Metal Head has increased substancially in the past two years. The increased income Stereve has experienced did come at a exceedingly expensive price. At the base of Stereve mountain a large monument was finished recently.

-To the day we have our victory-

	A small and simple epitaph was carved into it and lined with ivorite, the dawn aul argyle. In the past two years, Shahtz' personal taskforce has lost 10 squads; 50 of Stereve's most powerful residents. Their names are also engraved in the monument.

*Crayn* "Again, we thank you very much."

	Crayn Skilite (8) has made it a rule that all taskforce squads should say a quick prayer of thanks at the monument after every mission. It's not like he has any real power to do so. No one minds doing as such however. The monument gets visitors everyday from dozens of people. On occasion, a member of Metal Head will even offer a sincere word.

*Crayn* "Thanks for waiting Suan."

	Having finished his prayer, he calls out into a nearby tree.

<tweet~>

	Out from the branches comes a small bird; a common lau known as a Yago. She, as denoted by having a seventh wing on her left side, zooms around through the trees, leaving a silver trail of auls behind her; wind auls.

*Crayn* "Right right, we were going to go check out that weird space outside of the village. Do you still have the bag I gave you?"

*Suan* <whistle>

	Suan flies back up to the tree she sat on and pulled out a small bag. As she lifted it off the branch, a clicking sound similar to marbles came from the bag.

*Crayn* "Good, before we head out, let's head home for a second. I forgot my gems."

*Suan* <fweet fweet>

*Crayn* "I know, I know, but I didn't need them for this job. It was only a bodyguard mission."

	Crayn and Suan float away from the monument and go back to town. It isn't too late into the day. The sun has just started into its descent in the sky.

<Hrrrrrmmm>

	Passing through the village was a large delivery truck. A familiar scent eminated from it as it passed by.

*Crayn* "The truck for the red sunflowers-"

<Hoonnk>

	Most of the roads of the village are almost too narrow for such large vehicles to pass through. A second truck attempted to pass on the opposite side of the road; it appeared to have scraped the side of the sunflower truck.

*Crayn* "That was close! One of them must've been running late."

*Suan* <twooweet>?

*Crayn* "The drivers of those trucks work for the guild. The streets are too narrow for these trucks to get through side by side peacefully. Someone's supposed to be monitoring when these trucks come and go but someone must be asleep at the helm."

	Crayn and Suan are passing over the town center. The minor chaos of the trucks have passed and some kids come out to play again.

	In the past couple years, the village has taken on a normality similar to the time before the guild made its appearance. After school, children either go home to do homework or play outside and the adults carry out their work. The only thing that's really changed is the volume or danger of he work.

	To the southwest, a truck heads toward the mountains. The village produces two kinds of argyle for sale; Rubite, argyle of the fire aul, and Oxite, argyle of the wind aul. Mining of argyle is the more dangerous of the citizen's main jobs.

	To the east of the village lies an expansive field of red and yellow sunflowers. The village has its methods of extracting oils from the seeds but red sunflowers possess their own extraordinary traits.

	With the sale of these products, Stereve has enjoyed an increase in income. Originally, the extraneaous money was sent directly to the Gardeners. Metal Head now takes it and sends it to them (or so they claim).

*Suan* <Foooo>

	As soon as the two enter the Orgel house, two little girls come running to greet them.

*Luka* "Welcome home, Crayn. Hi Suanie!"

*Maka* "Mom and dad got us some red sunflower oil, so we used it to make snacks."

*Suan* <twitter twitter>!

*Maka* "Yeah, seeds too."

	Suan changes from perching on Crayn's shoulder to Maka's.

*Maka* "Let's go. We set up on the veranda."

	Suan and Maka follow the aroma of tea and cookies to the veranda.

*Crayn* "I'll be there in a moment, I need to go grab a thing from my room."

*Luka* "I'll be with those two then."

	He separates himself from the group and takes a quick walk to his room. Among the residents of the house, Crayn is the only one that has a room to himself.

	Finishing his business, he opens up his window and takes a short-cut to the veranda. He steps onto the window sill, unfolds his wings, and takes to the air, over the house.

*Suan* <fweet>

*Maka* "Yeah, we tried something new to squeeze the oil out of the seeds. There isn't nearly as much debris from the seeds."

*Luka* "Doesn't the tea look clearer than normal too?"

*Crayn* "These taste better each time you make them."

	The kids take their time to enjoy the snacks. Luka made the tea and Maka made cookies. Both of them were made using the oil of red sunflowers but among the residents of the village, the twins have had the best luck in using them in cooking.

*Crayn* "Just don't go selling these. I've heard stories in the city of people learning how to do things only to "sell out" later."

*Suan* <fweet>?

*Crayn* "It means to lose sight in what you believe in for personal gain."

	It should be noted that no one can truly understand what Suan says. On the other hand, she seems to comprehend a lot of what Crayn and the others say. In most cases, Crayn speaks to her as if he's speaking to one of his sisters.

*Crayn* "Thanks for the snacks. Suan and I are gonna head out for a little while. We should be back in time to get Mana from the daycare but keep an eye on the time in case
