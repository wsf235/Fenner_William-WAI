Thearian Year 9XX

	Several houses explode into flame and crumble to ash in seconds after a piercing screech shakes the evening sky. A large yago (bird type lau) hovers over a village in the north Tincalatian continent. On the ground, people scatter around, panicking. Screams of dispair and anguish resound as the bird flies around in the afternoon sky. Incident, crisis, such words could describe this situation. In the case of Lun Sabel, Marisa Orchestra, and Jamie Bastel...

-Business as usual.

-That poor bird.

-A bother...

	Three teens stare at each other questioningly, trying to classify the situation. A sword toting blonde boy, Lun (Loon), sees this as nothing more than strife between a high class yago, a Phoenix at that, and a simple village under seige. Marisa, a short girl with dark blonde hair holding a pike, paid more attention to the phoenix who seemed to be searching for something while remaining in the airspace of the village. In front of those two stood a fairly tall girl with a scythe folded and strapped to her back, partially hidden by her dark lavender hair. Of the three of them, Jamie, Scion of the Bastel family, murmured words of agitation at the situation.

-I guess we can't really overlook this can we?

-(Both) No.

	Jamie was outnumbered.

-With that decided, I'll go calm down the mother, you two go look for her child!

	From their position on the hilltop, Marisa was the first to leap into action. A heavy thud shook the hill and a pillar of earth propelled her into the sky toward the distraught bird.

-Ah, I forgot to ask her what the child should look like.

-The child of a lau like that shouldn't be too hard... wait, are you still telling me she can understand the tongue of a lesser lau?

-Don't worry about it. Things turn out fine when I leave this kind of situation to her.

	Jamie has always placed doubt on whether or not Marisa is really able to communicate with lau or not. It isn't too often that lau other than dathes or dragons can communicate with people but Marisa can somehow speak with them all.

	In her usual manner of giving in, she quiets down and descends the hill toward the village with Lun.

-So, I guess we're basically looking for that, except smaller?

	To clarify their search parameters, the two take a quick look at the lau in the sky, currently wrestling with the small figure making loops around its head as if trying to get its attention. The crimson, orange, and gold plummage is quite unique to the phoenix; the feathers tend to sell for a large sum of money, a thought that flashes through Jamie's mind.

-How many of those feathers do you think you'd need to help your parents get that addition to the house? Maybe even get those broken portions fixed up?

	A useless attempt at tempting the "straight laced" Lun.
