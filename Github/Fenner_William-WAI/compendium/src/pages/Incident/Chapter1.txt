Thearian Year 209X

	The eastern portion of West Cifapic has never been a stranger to anomalous elements. In particular, however, were the arrivals of the floating metal island to the far south and today's visitors to the village at the base of Stereve Mountain. Something odd could be felt from this group as even though they bore the position of Gardeners under the name of Metal Head. Few of them held their tongues and acted with respect; the rest carried themselves with disregard toward any sort of manners or sincerity. Normally, the streets of the village were overun with kids enjoying their youth while playing with the smaller dragon lau or yagos that make their way down the mountain. About three days ago, the dragons ceased contact with the villagers and the only ones seen have been the lesser dragons. Today, the only ones on the streets are guild members and adults running minor errands. These past few days have shown an uncanny silence.

	At the Orgel family's residence, a silent stand off occured late in the morning and has persisted well into the afternoon. In the dining room, a man of venerable stature and head of Stereve village, Benjamin Orgel, was staring down a leader of the Gardener group by the name of Shahtz.

-Are you so obstinate that you won't consider my offer? This village alone corners the market in red sunflower production and Argyle mining. With our help, you can reach even higher with the amount of Argyle you can harvest from this area.

	Before the chief could speak up, a red haired man in a suit speaks up.

-And after we siphon the land barren, what are we to do then? Our land just happens to be firtile enough to sustain our red sunflower crops. If we mine them for Argyle as well, what do you think will happen to it? We're not interested in expanding our economic stance or increasing our revenue!

	Makaw o Scarlett, head of Stereve's red sunflower production, speaks in place of the chief but looks to him for agreement. The chief nods in agreement as his statement was spot on to their situation. The red sunflower population in Stereve is higher than anywhere else in the world and despite the tons in output per year, the crops haven't experienced any sort of decline since harvesting first began.

-True. As I have said before, we aren't interested in any of your propositions. While I admire your determination... maybe I should call it greed... I simply cannot consent to anything you wish to accomplish on this mountain.

	Benjamin sighed as he reaches the end of his patience.

-In addition, I ask that you gather the members of your Gardener group and leave today. The temperament of your group really is unbecoming of members of the Gardeners.

	Makaw nods in agreement. Several of Stereve's older residents are independently contracted to the Gardeners and even Benjamin and Makaw are well known among some of the older members. The foreign leader stands to his feet and slams his hand on the table in frustration. A small shockwave could be felt in the room and the sound pierced the nearby halls of the house. The imprint left behind was fairly smooth but a splinter of wood caught his gloved hand and tore. The noticible shine of metal was sighted before he hid his hand behind his back.

-I'm sorry to have disturbed this humble village.

	Grimacing, Shahtz places the chair under the damaged table and silently marches out of the Orgel residence. Benjamin nods quietly and Makaw trails him.

-These conversations really aren't for kids you know.

	A thud and some scuffling is heard from a crack in the door behind him. Two heads peak out revealing two four year old children; the daughter of Makaw o Scarlett, Parot, and a child adopted into the Orgel family, Crayn Skilite. Beckoning the two in, they flutter through the door and settle in front of Benjamin. Tottering behind them were two more children, his twin daughters, Luka and Maka.

-How long have you little'uns been here?

-We heard a slam and wanted to see what happened.

	Fluttering up in the air again, Crayn took it upon himself to defend their eavesdropping.

-Where'd daddy go?

-He'll be right back sweetie. He only went to make sure the visitors leave peacefully so the village will go back to normal.

	To ease any suspicion of foul play, Makaw followed the guild's leader. The twins tapped at their father's legs asking for some of the water on the table. They were slightly out of breath as they had to run down the hall. Unlike Parot and Crayn, who had just gained full use of their wings, Luka and Maka still had to run to keep up with most of the other kids. It would still be another year before they could even begin trying to fly.

	Lunch was brought in during the conference between the two leaders but much of it went untouched when tensions rose high. Parot and Crayn took a moment to fly the twins over the table for a quick snack while they grabbed something for themelves. The main meal was beef with a blueberry flambee using red wine alongside some greens. The table was also dressed with various fruits and vegetables as well; many native, as are most of the village's food supplies, to the mountains of Stereve. After a maid took away Shahtz plate and disposed of it, Benjamin allowed the kids to pick off anything they saw.

-Don't eat too much, we're all going to have a nice pizza flambee for dinner tonight.

-We're eating here too?

	Parot's eyes lit up as she dug into her father's untouched plate. Her father recently returned from a business trip in the Tylian islands. The islands are well known for unique and underpracticed cooking techniques and Makaw happened to bring back a cookbook detailing much about Flambeeing. The two families have been enjoying such cooking for a little while now and often meet at each other's homes for it. The twins perked up and started clapping when as they heard this; if Crayn is their big brother, then they see Parot as a sister to the point of picking up some of her mannerisms.

-Of course!

-Assuming you clean up the mess you made in the girls' room, Parot.

	Makaw berates as he returns from his task. She inflates her cheeks and blows out tiny puffs of fire. The twins do mimic as well; one of the mannerisms they were able to pick up because all three of them are fire aulists. Crayn pacifies the girls and leads them out of the room to clean up before dinner.

-I have a few people keeping an eye on those guys but there haven't been any signs of trouble. They should be completely gone by this evening.

-Thank you, Makaw. It'll be nice to get the village back to a sense of normalcy.

-Our village has always been well off. The sunflower crops in conjunction with the spices and herbs we harvest from the mountains have brought us an excellent revenue for centuries. Aside from expenses, food, other necessities,or allocating an allowance to each household, we still have so much.

-And even then, we donate a lot of it to the Gardeners. It's not as if we actually need much extra income.

	Even after donating their excess income to the Gardeners, the parents of Stereve still have enough to send their children to any famous school they wanted. Even the highly covented Aulist Academies were well in their grasp. It's been quite a few years since this village has sent anyone off as there was a random gap in childbirths until about six years prior. Crayn and Parot are two of the village's older children and often attempt to act as rolemodels to other, younger kids.

-----------------------------------------------------

	Except for the occasional adult running errands, the evenings of the village of Stereve often belong to the children. Having filled their bellies with a nighttime of sustainance, the children take to the streets, floating about, chatting, or working off their dinners. Lively nights are the norm for this village and tonight shouldn't have been an exception. It shouldn't have been, however, despite the absence of the guild who shared the streets with the residents over the past few days, the same silence persisted.

-No one's around.

-Even the town centre's empty.

	Crayn and Parot went out after dinner. They were among the group of kids who liked to exercise after big meals.

-Did daddy ever tell everyone that those people are gone?

-If those people were the problem then the dragons and yagos should've come back. Why are things still so quiet?

	The two made laps around the village, knocking on doors and peering through windows on occassion. The residents of Stereve are a lively folk but the few who opened their doors made their speech brief and advised them to fly home quickly. With the sun having gone to sleep for the day, Crayn and Parot call off their investigation and head back to the Orgel household. In addition to dinner, the Scarletts were invited to stay over for the night as well.

	Even at the Orgel home, the atmosphere was no better than that of the village. The twins were sent to bed early and the adults were in the dining room with tense looks on their faces. Upon hearing Parot and Crayn passing through the front door, Benjamin twists his wrist and activates the house's door manipulation mechanism. A gust of wind races throughout the estate, closing all doors, and leading the kids to the rooms they are to sleep in for the night. Unlike earlier in the day, the two take the hint and retire for the night; Crayn to his room and Parot to the twin's room.

-Any way you slice it, it would be more advantageous to them if they looped around and came in from the direction of the ravine.

-It makes sense. They have the equipment to move around that area without much problem but I still agree with Makaw's conjecture. They'll be coming in from downwind, from Lyster's direction.

	A quiet conference was in progress in the dining room. A couple men are arguing back and forth.

-I believe you are all overestimating the intellect this man possesses, Makaw included.

	Benjamin speaks softly, his usual aid currently missing from his side. The leader of Metal Head and his men may have disappeared from the village, but no one thinks they've disappeared from Stereve. This location has too many things that they want for them to just get up and leave. Since supper, Makaw has been on the outskirts of the village, tracking any and all movements.

-If that man had such intellegence, taking this village from the ravine would make this quite an uphill battle for us. Most of our villagers, or even our aulists, aren't able to navigate the chaotic winds that blow from there. Fighting would be next to, if not outright, impossible. Conversely, we'd have less chance of escaping if they came from downwind. Not many of us can withstand moving against the wind. If anything, he'll merely attempt to surround the village or come from some random direction when he believes our guard is down.

	Benjamin has had contact with the guild's leader everyday over the past 3 days. Benjamin met him with hospitality each time despite the manners of Stereve's guests but Shahtz's true intentions showed through each time. His emotions were easily seen and he let himself get too heated at times. Benjamin judged him to be a fairly straightforward yet impatient man but that does little in considering countermeasures against him. At this moment, the villagers are expectigng to be attacked quite soon. Considering Benjamin's words, everyone present confines themselves to their thoughts for a moment before they return to their meeting.

-----------------------------------------------------

	Stereve, a village at the base of a mountain with the same name, is a peaceful and agriculturally well off place that boasts a population of about 4000. This population count doesn't take into account the number of greater lau that live in or around the village. Either way, despite the absence of the guild, the eerie silence of the village persists. Because of this, Crayn found it hard to sleep. He's used to hearing the sound of the crickets and frogs outside so the quietness is quite deafening to him.

-...

	No sounds, neither outside nor inside the house offer him any information. Feeling restless, Crayn gently hops out of bed, unfolds his wings, and hovers out of his room. The Orgel household is fairly large and its inner corridors get too dark for most to navigate reliably. The residents and usual visitors have a couple solutions for this. Most of Stereve's aulists are fire aulists. In this case, they can illuminate their path with a small flame. For this reason, most homes use candles, torches, or fire places (doesn't mean Stereve doesn't have electrical appliances however). In the case of Crayn and a few others...

-nnmmm! "Dazzler"...

	A tiny sphere of dawn auls forms in his hand. After restraining it for a moment, the sphere grows until he lightly tosses it into the air. Dazzler, a dawn aul skill originally made for escaping from enemies and predators. In the hands of a Mie class aulist, let alone, child, like Crayn, all it's really good for is lighting dark places.

	Hovering the light just above his head, he moves quietly down the hallway, toward his sisters' room. The kids' rooms are separated by a single guest room. At this point, it might as well be called the Scarlett family guest room. Not only do they seem to be the only ones who ever use it, Crayn seems to recall many of Makaw's trophys being sent there for a time, like last year's "Festival of Winter Flowers" martial arts tournament.

	On the other side of the hallway was the girls' room, Crayn's first destination. He dims the light sphere before opening the door to check on the girls. Nothing out o the ordinary. Luka and Maka were cuddled together with Parot embracing them both. Smiling to himself, he slowly closes the door only for it to make a slight creak just before it was completely shut. He stops all of his movements for a moment and listens to any sign that someone may have woken up. Silence. He pulls his hand off the door handle and moves further down the hall before making the light sphere brighter again.

	Crayn's actual destination was the dining room that is often used as a conference room. The door was shut earlier which is quite rare in this household. Something serious was being discussed however, as he comes to the door, it's open and is as if nothing was any different than normal. The table has since been repaired, returning the atosphere of the room to its usual state. Still restless, Crayn sets off to a new destination, outside.

-haah~

	Having stepped out of the house and hopped into the air, he breathes a sigh of relief and releases the dazzler from his control. The auls begin to dissipate as Crayn flies through the particle cloud. The dawn auls get caught in his wind and trail behind him, glittering before disappearing from sight. The nighttime air is cool and clean. Crayn started to feel gleeful as he hadn't participated in his usual evening romp around the village. Tonight was the first time he had ever ventured out after dark and he intended to make the best of Stereve's open space.

-Brother~!

	Though he intended to have some freedom tonight, a small voice called out to him from behind; the older one of his younger twin sisters, Luka. As Crayn floated down to quiet her down, he noticed a slight displacement in her shadow. It's unstable and she was struggling but she was indeed wobbling around in the air; flight. Thearian children her age shouldn't even be capable of this much but Crayn didn't question or care about that. He was happy enough that she could fly, albeit unstable.

-Keep your voice down and be a good girl, okay? I wanna go out for a bit.

-Kay~

-You should go on back to bed, okay?

-uh uh

	Luka shook her head and grabbed the bottom of his shirt. She motioned toward the village and tried to fly in that direction.

-Ah, stop stop! Okay, I'll take you with me for a bit, then back to bed, okay?

	She nodded and stopped tugging at Crayn. He took his little sister's newfound flying ability into consideration and flew close to the ground with her so she wouldn't get hurt if she fell.

	It took no more than about 3 minutes to get to the village from their home. The usual path is shrouded in trees so the two took a lighter path over a nearby lake. On a moonlit night like this, the lake shines with a radiance comparable to the light of a campfire. Crayn has known this sight all of his young life but, each time he sees it, it still amazes him. Tonight, he had a little guest to share this with; one who just discovered her wings and changed her own life. Luka's gasps of awe echoed across the lake until they reached the first houses bordering the village.

-----------------------------------------------------

-Where are those things you hear at night?

-...I don't know. Wouldn't they be asleep too?

	Luka was referring to the insects of the night world. Crickets are one such insect that responds sensitively to sound and movement. While the male cricket sings at night to attract their mates, they clam up at the smallest of disturbances.

	To Luka, this was merely an all too silent night. To Crayn, this was an uncanny night. The town still felt empty. Nevermind it being so late at night, this place was almost devoid of life. The street lamps, the houses, even the moon seemed to dim upon walking into the town center.

	Between two houses, several figures dashed in and out of the shadows. Several of them seemed to be carrying blades and rifles; the same as Stereve's recent visitors.

-hiii!

	A man with a red polearm made eye contact with Crayn. Try as he might, he couldn't hide his fear; he realized that he just saw a member of Metal Head. The man broke off in another direction, separate from Crayn's and his comrades. Remembering he's a big brother, he gathers himself the best he can in this situation and picks up his little sister.

-Be quiet, Luka. We need to go home really quick or we'll get in trouble, okay?

	The girl nods her head and complies with her brother. He scoops her up and prepares to take off. His legs buckle beneath him and he tumbles to the ground as an explosion rocks the cobblestone pavement under him. His wings help him regain his balance quickly without dropping Luka.

	More explosions were heard from another side of the village and a dark cloud began to form in the sky over the village. An intense heat began to creep along the wind and an orange glow began to fill the streets of the village. Ever the intellegent child, Crayn's assessment of this situation came as thusly; Metal Head is attacking Stereve and everyone's lives are in danger.

-Brother!

	A small voice brought Crayn out of his thoughts and reminded him that he wasn't by himself. Ordinarily, he would've attempted to investigate this incident, his own curiosity would compell him to do so.

	Still carrying his sister, he corrects his stance and prepares to take off again. His destination is home and his objective is safety.

-There's another kid! Catch'em quick!

	A short man carrying a short sword and a hand gun roars far behind Crayn. He spares no time in trying to stop the children from their escape and fires a couple of shots that easily miss both children.

-Hang on, Luka!

	She repositions herself so Crayn has the use of his hands again. There isn't much a mie class aulist like him can do but he hopes enough for a distraction. Squeezing both of his hands together, he wills as many dawn auls as he can together to form a small grenade.

-Dazzler!

	With much of his strength, Crayn hurls the grenade of light at his pursuer. His aim was off but the sphere passed close enough that he was able to detonate it effectively.

	The man growled as the painful light took his vision from him and left him in a panic. In frustration, he began firing his pistol wildly as Crayn took this opportunity to make his escape with his sister. A stray bullet tore into Crayn's wing. This was enough to send him back toward the ground, only having enough air time to twist his body and protect Luka from the impact. 

-You little shits! That hurt a lot!

	The guild member stumbled around for a moment before making his way over to the fallen children.

-My damn eye ain't acting right... horrible night... and you made me waste my bullets. BRAND NEW SMITH & WESSON! I'm dirt broke, took me FOREVER to get the bullets for this! You can't get these from around these parts.

	He complained viciously while swinging his knife back and forth. The children slowly stood up and backed away from him as much as they could. Luka's flight was still too unstable for her to do anything with and the bullet hole in Crayn's wing has made flight a foreign sensation to him, he couldn't use it. They finally ran out of space and bumped into a shovel. The tool fell in front of them from its resting place and attracted the attention of the angry man. His eyes fell on the two frightened children.

-This whole thing would've gone so much better for me if you two weren't around... you two are a damn waste of bullets. But I'm gonna fix that...

	His eyes were fixed on the children as he began walking toward them. Raising his short sword, he resembled a large efreet, cornering his prey, ready to finish the job. A burning world as the backdrop, he leapt toward his targets and swung the blade...

-----------------------------------------------------
<> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <>
-----------------------------------------------------

	A young child awoke in her bed, lying next to the four year old girl she views as her older sister.

-Parot, I had bad dream...

	As she shook her sleeping neighbor, she surveyed her and her sister's room. Her older twin sister is missing.

-Maka, what is it? I'm sleepy... Where's Luka?

	Maka's expression turned nervous as she pulled at Parot's sleeves. The two got out of bed and moved out of the room quickly.

-Did Luka go to the toilet, Maka?

	Before moving in the direction of Maka's beckoning, Parot made the decision to go see Crayn in his room. His little sister was acting odd so he should at least know about it; no reason to wake up the adults.

	To light her path, she employed a special skill of her own; one employed through the use of the fire aul. Upon holding her arm outward, it began to glow and a warm light spread out before her. The dark hallway lit up and its form became clear to the two girls.

	Parot opened the door to Crayn's room to only to find his room without its owner. Maka's expression visibly turned from that of nervousness to fear and panic and she began to point Parot toward the front door.

	Maka's never acted like this before, Parot thought. Anxiety began to cloud her own expression as she was pulled down the hallway and toward the front door. Making as little noise as possible, she opened the front door and followed the frantic little girl outside.

	While inside the house, the two made as little noise as possible but once they stepped out side, Maka's panic became audible.

-The village! Go, go!

-Okay Maka, c'mere and hold on tight.

	Parot bent over a bit and Maka clung to here like a baby animal. Rather than a shortcut over the nearby lake, Parot flew through the tree-covered pathway connecting the Orgel house and the village.

-Hmm? Why is there a fire?

	As expected of a fire aulist, she could feel the smallest changes in heat from a fair distance away. All too rapidly, that small change exploded into a much larger flare. At this point, Maka is crying her eyes out while pointing Parot to their destination, the town center.

	The girls touch down behind a house next to the town center. The heat wasn't a problem for them but the slowly encroaching smoke threatened to suffocate them.

	Darting through the alleyways were men with weapons.

-Stay close...

	Parot caught sight of them and pulled Maka close, hoping to muffle her crying as much as she could without hurting her. They moved along quickly, with purpose, and were out of sight in mere seconds.

-Whew... We should be fine for now Maka.

	She released Maka from her hold who then took a deep breath. At this point, she had stopped crying and took off through the houses without any other pause. She quickly left Parot behind. Before she could chase after, an imposing figure wielding a red trident appeared beside her and sealed off her movements.

-----------------------------------------------------
<> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <>
-----------------------------------------------------

-hah hah hah~!

	She's only two years old but something in the deepest pit of her heart drove her legs in a specific direction. She has no idea what it is herself. She only knows that something is about to happen that would throw her world into dispair.

	Unconsciously knowing her destination is right next to her, she turns the last corner and faces a scene she's already knows.

-My damn eye ain't acting right... horrible night... and you made me waste my bullets. BRAND NEW SMITH & WESSON! I'm dirt broke, took me FOREVER to get the bullets for this! You can't get these from around these parts.

	Watching her brother and older twin sister back away quietly, a man is voicing a myriad of complaints while thrashing about with his sword.

-This whole thing would've gone so much better for me if you two weren't around... you two are a damn waste of bullets. But I'm gonna fix that...

	His eyes fall in the cornered children and he walks over to end their lives.

-Noo~!

	Maka's movement was automatic. The man had raised his sword and began swinging it downward. In a diagonal slice meant to cut across the chests of bothe children at once...

-!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

	A soundless scream rang out as a shallow slash cut across the back of the younger twin who dove in front to push them out of the way.

-MAKA!

	The man was startled by the sudden loud cry from Crayn and fell sideways, partially driven by his forward momentum. Crayn and Luka dashed closer to Maka, still letting out her silent cry of pain.

-One after another, you little pieces of shit keep wasting my time!

	He tries to sit up from his fall but the man's patience has long reached its limit and he pulls out his handgun a second time. His movement to take aim stops abruptly and his body slinks back to the ground.

-Hey, are you kids alright?

	Toting a large red trident, a tall man with a large muscular build and battle scarred visage appeared behind the fallen assailant. He spoke kindly to the tormented children while scanning the area to ascertain what happened.

	His visage turned grim as he located the most pressing of matters, Maka whose body had gone limp. A small cough escaped her mouth indicating that she's still alive; she's merely fainted. However, she's been dealt a serious injury.

-Parot, you watch over the other little girl. We need to get this one to a doctor.

	Running from behind him came Parot who had met up with this seemingly kind man only moments ago. She ran over to Luka, unharmed but unconscious after the ordeal.

-Stay back!

	Crayn shouted.

-I saw you with those guys earlier, you're one of them too, aren't you?

-Aye... I won't lie to you about that but I hope you'll understand that I'm not like a lot of those other ruffians. If you want, I can tell you more later but first we need to get this girl some help. Pass her here carefully.

	The entire time, Crayn kept a tense expression but complied with the man anyway. His sister needed help desperately.

	As he relinquished his sister to the man, they hear a light slapping sound. Crayn and Parot's eyes widen at the sight. Both of Maka's wings have just fallen to the ground...

-----------------------------------------------------
<> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <>
-----------------------------------------------------

	The sun, partially covered by a cloud of smoke, peaks over the mountains of Stereve and the last of the fires has been put out. In front of the assembled Thearian residents of the village, a tall man in a suit raises a metal fist into the air.

-Many of you already know my name; you know who I am. My name is Shahtz, leader of the Gardener guild known as Metal Head. I'll go ahead and skip on the details of how easily this operation went but we came, we saw, we CONQUERED quite easily at that!

	The details of the invasion went thusly. Before yesterday's meeting between Benjamin and Shahtz, a few guild members snuck into houses in the village and tied up the residents. He also knew he was being tailed by Makaw o Scarlett; Makaw was captured as well. With one of Stereve's best aulists missing, sneaking in and beginning Stereve's capture was trivial. That night, a couple incidents occured here and there which resulted in a few families making their escape. The only major incident occured between two senior members.

	On stage, an unseeable feud was occurring between two men; one of them was of heroic stature and kept a trident by his side and the other was a short man with a holstered Smith & Wesson and a bottle of hard liquer in hand. Between Shahtz, yammering away on the stage platform, and the two men, sparks flying between them, nobody was focused. At least, not on them. Of approximately 3000 residents of Stereve, only about 500 were present at the speech and their focus was entirely set on the edges of the crowds. Well-armed guards stood watch over the crowds of Thearians and occasionally pointed their guns and blades at the audience members as if denying their freedom. To rephrase, they reminded the audience that they've lost their freedom.

-Which brings me to the next topic!

	Not that anybody was listening to him.

-This village. It's a really nice place.

	He held a sarcastic look on his face. The look of a person who's lived in the city all of his life. It was easy to see that he never enjoyed the atmosphere of Stereve.

-Odds are, you've lived quite a nice life around here. Friends with the lizards on the mountains, plantations full of red sunflowers, mountains full of argyle; this village is actually quite wealthy. That's about to change.

	At the snap of his fingers, a bruised and battered man is brought up to the platform. One of the signature changes of a fire aulist, his scarlet hair, and the tattered remains of a dapper dark red suit identified him immediately and sent a scream of terror through the audience.

-Quiet down, quiet down.

	Having caught the audience's attention, a smug look dons Shahtz' face and he grabs the beaten celebrity by the hair.

-Given this reaction, I assume you all know this man here. Once this man heals up a bit, he, Makaw o Scarlett, will be leading about half of you in going up into those mountains and mining for argyle; in particular, Purple Sapphite, the lunar aul argyle this village is so proud of.

	He tosses Makaw to the side who almost slips off the stage and brushes his hand against his pant leg.

-The other half of you will be led into working and expanding the red sunflower plantations. The harvest of both resources will be sold and all profits will go to... well, us.

	Rather than voices of fear, anguish, or despair, silence pervailed as everyone simply pierced Shahtz with hateful, angry gazes. He easily took notice.

-While I'm on a roll, in about two years time, 300 of you are going to be inducted into my own personal army. I figured that some of you will be more useful than others. I mean, we ARE still a guild in the service of the Gardeners.

	His tone slowly became more spiteful and he awaited a desirable response from his captives. They still remained quiet. The people of Stereve maintain their malicious gaze. Fed up with this, Shahtz clenches his metal fist and marches off the stage.

-Bunch of chlorofreaks...

	He voiced an uncommon and outdated insult aimed at Thearians as he left. With the meeting over, the tension began to lighten up. Of the duo that sat of stage feuding, the taller, more heroic looking of the two stood up and helped Makaw to his feet. The villagers had seen him around the village over the past few days. Grants Teres, fire and earth aulist, was one of the few guild members the residents of Stereve came to hold in kind regard.

	Another villager flew over to help Makaw. Being a moderately sized village, it was equiped with a couple medical facilities which were needed urgently. Makaw wasn't in serious peril but if he was to work in the argyle mines as Shahtz had planned, much less keep the full use of his body, he would need medical care and a couple weeks of rest; a recovery expected to be quick due to the naturally rapid recovery rate Thearians possess.

-...I'm sorry everyone...

	Before taking the injured man offstage, those in the front row hear Grants murmur an apology. Words that were able to reach the ears of two children in particular, Parot o Scarlett, who was affected by the sight of her beaten father, and Crayn Skilite, who wore a determined expression unbefitting of a child his age.

	The rest of today would become Stereve's final moment of reprieve. From today on, the lives of thousands Thearians would be thrown into hopeless chaos.
