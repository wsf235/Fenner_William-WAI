	By no means was the attitude of the villagers of Stereve false bravado, however it was quickly suppressed the following day; following the invasion of the Gardener guild, Metal Head. As commanded by the guild's leader, Shahtz, an extensive screening began with the intention of finding 300 thearians with the greatest power, skill, or potential for his own personal task force. The remaining 2600 (appox) have been split up into two groups; the miners and the fielders.

	By no means did anyone fail to see the attack coming, but the timing was too hurried. Two years have passed and about 300 citizens remain unaccounted for. In general, they are presumed dead. Some took their families and fled into the mountains or the nearest city, Lyster. As rare as winged thearians have become in the world, tracking any of them down shouldn't pose a problem to the guild. Some of them have even been captured and returned to Stereve by agents of the guild as far out as the Northern Tincalatian continent.

	On the southside of the village (toward the mountains), a training institution was erected for the 300 selected thearians of Shahtz's taskforce. In the end, it's not much more than a school to the residents of Stereve and more than the selected persons attended it. Not wanting to make more trouble than it's worth, Shahtz allowed it.

"We'll have a more strict test review next class but for now..."

	From her podium at the rear of the classroom, Ms. Mizu Umi, a mermaid, calls out the name of a random student.

*Mizu* "Tukan, recite the Eleven Auls Prose. You all are dismissed after that."

	Tukan Pricilla, one of the shortest kids in the class, suddenly raises her head from her esoteric drawings. Her white hair, a visible characteristic of the dawn aul, glitters as it catches the sunlight and she recites the prose as instructed.

*Tukan* "Ehm...
The dancing red, effervescent in its life, the fire aul cleanses its path.

The dancing blue, calm in its life, the water aul also cleanses its path.

The stalwart copper, immovable in its functions, the earth aul denies others their passage.

The stalwart silver, perpetual in its functions, the wind aul allows all their passage.

The lively yellow, sustaining in all life, the solar aul gives form to all.

The lively lavender, maintaining in all life, the lunar aul gives function to all.

The polar white, purifying in its actions, the dawn aul casts its blinding light.

The polar black, corrupting in its actions, the dusk aul casts its deathly shade.

The polar gold, neutralizing in its actions, the twilight aul renders all to zero.

The esoteric azure, bounding in all the world, the sky aul becomes form.

The esoteric violet, empowering in all the world, the void aul becomes energy...

1, 2... that's all eleven verses."

	Without waiting for a signal, the children stand up and pack their things to leave. Mrs. Umi sighs and returns to her desk at the front of the room. Her wings refract sunlight as she passes by the window; she pats Tukan on the head and whispers her a, "good job" on the way. Four other children gather around Tukan's desk as she finishes packing together her stuff. The ones known as Squad 18, her teammates. The first one to greet her is the ever calm and collected Hawk Wright.

*Hawc* "I don't think anyone noticed, but you changed parts of all the verses didn't you? Not that anyone else ever gets it right."

*Lark* "As long as we know all 11 auls, what's the big deal?"

	The next to speak is the normally quiet Lark Urvan. He seats himself on a neighboring desk.

*Lark* "If we needed to know the specifics of everything, aulists wouldn't be considered esoterics, right?"

*Parot* "It's BECAUSE it's an esoteric art that we need to know so much. Tukan, we only know why your hair is such a pretty white because of it."

*Crayn* "In the first place, wasn't it Lark who decided that we should impress the teachers with some super intricate skill? Can't really complain about knowing so much now..."

	Two more contribute to the chat; Parot o Scarlett, heiress to Stereve's red sunflower and spice productions, and Crayn Skilite, foster child of the village leader, Benjamin Orgel. The two stand out among their classmates similarly to Tukan; Parot's long, auburn hair's the envy of many and Crayn's mystical, violet hair color always draws second and third glances. In general, all of Squad 18 are well known. Intellectually, they've surpassed their 6 and 7 year old peers, and as aulists, they've done the same.

	Lark seizes one of Tukan's drawings and looks it over. The page is full of scribbles, slashes, and other unintelligible marks. The five of them can read these marks easily.

*Lark* "So, how should we balance this out?"

*Hawc* "If these are the positions we should be in... Lark, you should be here and handle the water aul. I'll take care of earth."

*Crayn* "I have the wind aul then. Parot's got fire covered so could you take care of the dawn aul, Tukan?"

*Tukan* "It's the only aul I can use, so why not."

*Hawc* "The test is on friday. We have plenty of time to work on getting this right."

*Parot* "I don't think we'll have time today though. Didn't Mr. Teres call for us today?"

	Contrary to the other squads of Shahtz' taskforce, the members of Squad 18 have a teacher. Grants Teres, something of a VIP in the guild, prefers to be called a teacher. At the end of the day, the thearian residents of Stereve are little more than slaves and the captains of the taskforce squads are save masters. Grants has repeatedly expressed his disapproval over this. He chose to renounce any forceful control over Squad 18 and took on the more peaceful role of a teacher.

-----------------------------------------------------
<> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <>
-----------------------------------------------------

	There are 60 squads in Shahtz' taskforce; all of them are made up of winged thearians. Of the 4 thearian races, they possess the greatest biological advantages. The large leaves steming from their backs allow them tireless flight. These leaves also carry out the signature ability of green plants, Photosynthesis, be they in sunlight or moonlight.

*Grants* "So even without your skills as aulists, the guild would try to find exceptional use for you five."

*Parot* "But they do keep us. So they actually expect something from us as aulists; that's why they keep us around?"

*Grants* "In the end, Shahtz is afraid that any small thing could ruin his whole operation here, and with the taskforce, he could not only take on jobs from the Gardeners, but keep an eye on you all while keeping you busy; two birds with one stone."

	In the Orgel household, Grants and the five of Squad 18 gold a meeting amongst themselves. With sunset approaching, Crayn invited everyone over for dinner. Despite the village's captivity, somethings haven't changed much, like the Orgel house's culinary expertise. Parot brings up a concern of hers.

*Parot* " So, what of my father?"

*Grants* "Good point, Parot. 'Makaw is too powerful to roam free, let alone train him any further in the arts we plan to teach the others in the task force', is Shahtz' basic thought."

*Lark* "So he's kept in the argyle mines or in the fields under close survallence. He's an example."

*Grants* "Exactly. As it is, just keeping Parot in the taskforce is enough to keep him in check. Shahtz is bullying him."

	Tears well up in Parot's eyes upon hearing this. She already knew the hardships her father faced, day after day. Makaw o Scarlett, the only one currently capable of releasing Stereve from it's forced servitude, had a hostage held against him; his daughter.

*Grants* "Sorry, that was inconsiderate of me."

	Tukan extends her wings and embraces Parot.

*Crayn* "So what you're saying is that we need to bide our time until someone else is strong enough..."

*Grants* "Which brings us to our next topic..."

	Grants brings the current topic to a close; echoing footsteps in the hallways signify the return of the household's other members. The previous conversation didn't take too long but the meeting would need to be cut short if the wrong people were to come in. Fortunately, the footsteps continue past the dining hall and fade away into nothing.

*Grants* "Our activities are going to be slightly different from that of many other squads. Understand this and don't speak of our work around others, got it?"

	The collective members nod in agreement and commit it to memory. It was never directly said, but this life of servitude isn't going to last, and they are going to see to that.

*Grants* "I think we might have time for what I really called you together for. You guys have a test this coming Friday, correct?"

*Tukan* "Yeah, Mrs. Umi's holding a practical test for her aulist class. She wants everyone to demonstrate their control over whatever auls we can use."

*Hawc* "She's giving out a large amount of extra credit for original skills."

*Grants* "And knowing Lark, you guys probably have something interesting in the works."

	Grants gaves around the room as he says this. Both Lark and Tukan avert their eyes as he meets them.

*Grants* "Well here's where my announcement comes in. Squad 18!"

	Reflexively, the children hop to attention.

*Grants* "You guys have recieved your first mission which is to be carried out this Friday. I will give you the details a little bit later as more information comes in."

*Hawc* "Then, what about our test?"

*Grants* "That... will occur in the course of the mission. Your practical test grade will reflect the success of the mission itself. I'll talk to Mizu, err Mrs. Umi. Next time we meet will be early Friday morning. EARLY. Until then, practice that skill you've been working on and make sure you're well rested. Meeting adjourned for dinner."

	A knock at the door brought in several more people. The warm aroma of pasta sauce began to fill the dining hall as cooks brought in several trays of tonight's dinner. Following were the pattering of tiny sandals; Maka and Luka scampered into the room with their father and and mother, Deborah, following close behind.

*Crayn* "..."

	As the twins climb into the seats beside Crayn, he catches Maka wincing as the tiny leaves twitch painfully on her back. Two years have passed yet they've only grown back so little after being severed once already. Even now, she still feels the pain of losing her wings. "I'll make this stop. That guy's gonna pay for what he's done to this village...", Crayn repeats this in his mind over and over until he's lost track of how many times he's thought it.

*Maka* "Daddy, pepper please?"

	That cheerful voice wipes away much of his hatred. There's nothing he can do for now but get stronger. A consensus most likely shared between everyone at the table.

-----------------------------------------------------

	Six figures dash through the darkness. The wind can't keep up with them and stirs the world of silence. In the darkness where early birds still sleep, Grants Teres and the members of Squad 18 make their way toward the closest major road between Stereve and Lyster, one of the few cities in West Cifapic. Despite not being a winged thearian and carrying his large rubite trident, Grants showed no trouble in staying ahead of the children. In fact, he often had to slow down for them; a testament to his years of combat experience.

*Grants* "!!!"

	He jumps far ahead and plants himself into the ground like a javelin. At his signal, the children land in the trees just behind him; they've reached their checkpoint.

*Grants* "This is where I want you to carry out the mission. I'll leave it to you to come up with the exact plan but the truck will be around in about 15 minutes. I'll be watching from a distance but I think you guys should do just fine."

*Crayn* "And in the event that we miss?"

*Grants* "I'll finish it up myself. Don't think about that thought, you're test starts when that truck gets here. Show me what this week's work has brought you."

*Children* "Yes sir!"

	Grants chuckles, taps his trident against the ground and disappears into the earth. One of his skills as an earth aulist.

*Parot* "Let's review."

*Hawc* "In about 10 minutes, the armored truck should be coming over the eastern hill. It should be carrying about 5 tons of raw purple sapphite argyle. We'll have Parot confirm this as it gets near. Our mission is to stop the truck long enough for us to make off with about 1 ton of it."

*Lark* "Being an armored truck, it's bound to have at least a viguro class aulist or two on board. Before we can worry about the argyle, we need to take out the guards."

*Crayn* "We determined that a direct fight would be too dangerous, right? Tukan, finished writing up the variant to our new skill right?"

*Tukan* "I didn't even need to write it. All you have to do is..."

	The five confirm their plan and get into position, five minutes until the truck arrives.

	Parot races up the road to make her confirmation. Aside from being a fire aulist, she is also a lunar aulist. Sensing 5 tons of purple sapphite is like feeling the warmth of the sun on her cheek. After flying back to her position, she signals to the others that everything is as it should be.

*Crayn* "!?"

	Crayn's position is in a tree on the southern side of the road. The bushes below him shift and shake until a dragon pops its head out and stares at him.

*Tukan* "Crayn, can you toss a dazzler at that dragon?"

	Tukan's position is just above his on the same tree. As if reading her mind, he quickly gathers the dawn aul in his hand and throws a small sphere of light at the dragon. It surprises it and it quickly races out into the middle of the road; right into the path of the armored truck.

*Tukan* "Now!"

	The truck screeches to a halt trying to avoid the large lizard which puffs a small stream of fire at the truck before it scurries off.

	In motions that have been practiced dozens of times, the children assume the formation of a square pyramid around the vehicle. Auls begin to gather and organize themselves according to the whims of their users. Crayn gathers wind auls, Parot gathers fire auls, Lark gathers water auls, Hawc gathers earth auls, and Tukan, at the top of the formation, gathers dawn auls. A M.A.G.I.C (Method of Auls Giving In to Commands) specially crafted by Tukan and Lark designed to help them accomplish their mission, Esoteric Chime. The auls, in place, begin to vibrate and distort the space around them. The armored plating of the vehicle began to distort as well.

*Tukan* "Alright, do it now!"

	At her signal, the light produced by Tukans dawn auls intensifies. The other four follow suit and use more power as well. The space around them begins to calm itself and the vibrations slow to a stop. Even the truck began to restore its shape.

*...*

	The feat was done in a matter of seconds. The lights fade one by one and the children keep watch over the armored truck for a moment. The dull roar of the engine remained constant yet nothing moved. Nobody stepped out of the vehicle either.

*Lark* "I think we did it."

	Lark moves to check the windows of the vehicle. From the outside, they were difficult to see through but his examination revealed 4 bodies. The driver was slumped over in his seat. Next to him and behind were 3 other men, also unconscious. They apparently held staves prior to their stop but they lookd just as inactive as their wielders.

*Lark* "I don't know about the driver but there are three others in here. I think they were manual aulists. They're all unconscious, the skill worked!"

	That the men were manual aulists was a lucky break for the children. Manual Aulists can only use manipulate auls as long as they have some sort of medium, those staves in this case. Anything that would loosen the staves from their grip would've been enough to temporarily disable them.

	Lark and Tukan take precautions and wrest the staves from the guards while Hawc goes to open the truck.

*Hawc* "This is really convenient."

	Doors of these armored vehicles are not only locked and keyed, but have special M.A.G.I.C placed on them to repel theives.

	Gathering the earth aul once more, he places his hands on the handles of the door. A low rumble echoes from inside the truck followed by a snap. He and Crayn pull open the door revealing hundreds of crates.

*Crayn* "Have you guys taken care of the guards?"

	He shouts to Lark and Tukan at the front who've just finished taking small pieces of argyle out of the guards' staves. The two place the gems on the floor of the truck and return the staves to their hands.

*Parot* "We need to bring back about 1 ton of this right?"

*Crayn* "Tylia... pre-shined... 50 pounds... there should be about 200 boxes in here. We need about 40. Let's start unloading, we probably have about an hour before they wake up from that."

*Hawc* "We need to figure out how we'll move all of these. For now, let's just take these into the woods toward the village."

*Tukan* "We didn't see any purple sapphite in their weapons. None of them are lunar aulists, I think."

*Parot* "I guess we can move these about a mile toward the village then. Even in they are lunar aulists, they shouldn't be able to notice that we've moved any that far out."

	The hardest part of the operation is over now. The low hum of the truck's engines is enough to mask the noise made by the children moving the boxes around. One by one, they moved as much as they could in the span of about 40 minutes. Accumulating about twice as many boxes as they needed, they returned the truck to how it was before they meddled with it. In all, the operation probably took about 55 minutes to complete after Grants left the squad to their own devices. About 55 minutes after he left, he returned. The children have just finished restacking the remaining crates of argyle in the truck and shutting the door. They had no idea how the locking mechanism of the door worked. Fortunately, it was an automatic lock, that saved the children any further dealings with the vehicle.

*Grants* "Do the guards have their weapons in hand?"

	Lark and Tukan reply quietly.

*Grants* "You kids did good. Let me give you a hand real quick... hold this for me."

	Standing closest to him was Crayn. At Grants' request, Crayn took his trident from him. The teacher walks over to the front of the armored vehicle and peers inside the window. The guards remain asleep. A look of intrigue covers his face and quickly disappears into a smile. He takes a calm, deep breath and places his hand under the truck.

*Lark* "...he's..."

	The children are dumbstruck at the spectacle. The vehicle slowly begins to raise off the ground.

*Grants* "Huuuoooh..."

	With a quiet exhale, he shifts the vehicle to its right, off the road, into the dirt and mud.

*Parot* "...I understand! It would seem too unnatural if they woke up in the middle of the road. The last thing they'll probably remember is almost running over a small dragon in the road."

*Hawc* "Like this, they'll believe that they fell into a ditch trying to evade it."

*Grants* "It's nice that you kids catch on quickly. Also, I'm proud of your way of taking care of this mission. In all of this, everyone is unharmed and we got what we needed. You'll be graded better in a second; this isn't the best place to do this."

	His face glowing with pride, he points the children in the direction of their stash. Even now, the sun has yet to make any sign of its apearance. Before trouble rear's its ugly head, Grants and Squad 18 take their leave of the scene.

-----------------------------------------------------

*Mizu* "Good morning children!"

	Sitting atop the crates of argyle was the children's aulist instructor, Mizu Umi. As early in the morning as it may be, the children were more shocked than confused as to why their teacher was in the middle of the forest in her pajamas.

*Mizu* "That was wonderful! Full marks! A+!"

	Her excitement stood out more than her attire. She could barely contain herself.

*Parot* "Um, Ms. Umi? Why are you here?"

*Grants* "I told you, didn't I? On top of this being your first mission, you were being tested."

*Mizu* "None of you noticed, did you? I practically had a front row seat. I was so close that I could even feel the vibrations of the wave auls!"

*Grants* "I thought I'd tell her about this morning's mission. I thought you all probably be tired after this so I wanted her to give you all the day off."

*Mizu* "You don't need to come in to class today, the practical was all I had planned anyway. Aside from that..."

	She hopped down from her perch atop the crates and skipped over to the children.

*Mizu* "I knew you guys were working on something as well. In case you decided to show it off, Grants wanted me to tag along."

	She moved closer and embraced Tukan. It was probably fatigue setting in but Mizu's gentle stroking of her head began to lull her to sleep.

*Crayn* "Ms.Umi, you said something about wave auls? I've never heard of an aul like that. Weren't there only 11 auls in existence?"

*Mizu* "Ah well, calling it an aul is definitely confusing. Don't worry too much about that, it's just a term."

	As the teacher began a quick lesson on the wave aul, Grants took the opportunity to examine the crates of argyle.

*Mizu* "There are only 11 auls. That skill you all used made use of the wave aul though. So, what IS the wave aul? Any ideas?"

	Ms.Umi glanced at the faces of her puzzled students.

*Hawc* "I think I know."

	Hawc raised his hand confidently.

*Hawc* "I used it again after we stopped the truck. We all made the auls vibrate right? When I used it the second time on the door, I thought, 'maybe I could use this to jiggle the lock open.' The wave aul is what happens when auls vibrate like this.

	Hawc held up his hand and focused auls into it. After a second, the air began to shake and stir like the bass of a stereo.

	Ms.Umi froze. Hawc basically understood what the wave aul was and clearly demonstrated it.

*Tukan* "While I was researching, Hawc often came to help me. We never found anything about the wave aul itself, just the concept of vibrating auls..."

	She sleepily whispered to Ms.Umi.

*Tukan* "Lark came up with the main idea though. Hawc was the one who wanted to try it out."

	Ms.Umi glanced over at Lark next. He looked away; his face practically glowing red.

*Lark* "Wel, we're a team right? I wanted all of us to do something together. If anything, Crayn and Parot are the amazing ones. We started drawing up the plans for the skill last week but they didn't know much of anything until a couple days ago. The basically learned the wave aul in a couple days.

	Yet again, Ms.Umi shifted her view.

*Crayn* "!? Ah, well I just thought, 'Vibrate', and I slowly felt like I got the hang of it"

*Parot* "I just watched Crayn do it. It's not the easiest thing to do though..."

*Crayn* "Hawc seems to know the wave aul the best. I can't use the earth aul so I don't know exactly what he did, but when he opened the door to the vehicle, I heard a dull rumble where he placed his hand. Moments later, the lock came loose inside and we could open the door."

	At this point, Tukan was sound asleep. The children continued to praise each other as Ms.Umi stood there. "They know so much already...", she thought. Looking at the sleeping child in her embrace,
she couldn't help but smile.

*Mizu* "The wave aul is what occurs when an aulist vibrates the auls under their command."

	The children stop talking and pay attention to their teacher's lecture.

*Mizu* "It was discovered by Oren, the creator of Thear, in the 9th century in the course of his experiments. Even now, it's said that he continues his experimentation but because of his tendency to hide incomplete information, all we know about it is what any individual aulist finds out. That is, assuming they're willing to share it."

	In their research, Tukan and Hawc found very little information on the wave aul; not even the name was mentioned. Majority of what the children knew came from practice after seeing the word "vibrate" in relation to M.A.G.I.C.

*Mizu* "Let me ask, how did you know that your skill would do what it needed to do to the guards inside of the truck? You found out about the wave aul only a few days ago after all."

	In a roundabout way, Ms.Umi was curious as to whether or not the skill was truly aimed at knocking out the user's opponents.

	Crayn raised his hand next.

*Crayn* "We found that out by accident. {Esoteric Chime}, as Tukan calls it, was originally meant to break things. We found that with the wave aul, we were able to cause major disturbances in the affected space. In most of our tests, we saw the warping of physical space and the destruction of large and small objects. Not many things showed resistance."

	It should be noted that all of Squad 18 are six years old, except for Tukan who is seven.

*Lark* "In yesterday's test of the skill, we got interrupted. While we were trying to break a large boulder, an earth leviathan wandered in the way. It was so sudden that we panicked and tried to stop the skill. Before we finished, we saw the leviathan stop moving. We thought we killed it!"

*Crayn* "The skill was still active when it wandered in. When we finally managed to stop, we went to see what exactly happened. It was just unconscious."

*Hawc* "After that, we tried this again with a small dragon. We remembered how much power we put into it and successfully recreated the skill as it was when the leviathan  got involved."

*Mizu* "In other words, you made sure to test it before using it today? Very good!"

	She attempts to applaud her students, but the body leaning against her reminds her of the time and place.

*Mizu* "I can't express how proud of you all I am."

*Grants* "Me neither. The wave aul's quite an advanced thing. Most aulists have never even heard of it."

	He had been quiet for a little while but Grats makes his presence known again.

*Grants* "That skill must've tired her out. Even if she's the oldest, she's still the smallest of you five."

	Referring to Tukan asleep in Ms.Umi's arms, he gently pulls her away and picks her up.

*Grants* "The sun is still down so you all should get back home and get some shut eye. You deserve it."

	He motions for everyone to head back to the village.

*Crayn* "We should start carrying the-"

	Remembering their purpose, the children turn to the crates of argyle.

*Children* "!?"

	Where piles of crates should've been, only a shallow impression in the ground remains.

*Grants* "That conversation looked like it was gonna take a while so I took care of them all. They're already in the village's storehouses."

	Whether it was all at once or multiple times over, Grants covered the span of at least 60 or 70 miles in a matter of minutes.

	With nothing left to do, the group left for home.

-----------------------------------------------------
<> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <>
-----------------------------------------------------

*Grants* "So what function would the fire and dawn auls have?"

	The two teachers followed just behind the children. Tukan was still asleep in Grants' arms.

*Mizu* I doubt the kids really even know. If I had to guess... that skill's destructive properties are more powerful than they initially expected. The positions they took were most likely meant to contain the effects of the skill.

	The air around the two seemed far more casual than one would expect. Like that of two who've known each other for a long time.

*Mizu* "The only auls that probably mattered in their skill would be water, earth, and wind. Solid, liquid, and gas, three of the states of matter, are being affected by the skill. As I take it, the disturbance caused by the skill assaults the entity within their formation and the effect is based on how much power they put into it. I can vaguely guess the dawn aul but what would the fire aul do?"

*Grants* "Even if I am a fire aulist, I can't think of a purpose for the fire aul in this situation."

*Mizu* "Hahaha! Even the great Magma Poseidon doesn't know."

*You said it yourself, only the individual aulists would really know what's what. If the kids ever decide to research this further, I hope they'd share that information."

	The two look at the children around them. The kind and intellegent Lark Urvan. Hawc Wright, curious and talented. Tukan Pricilla, bright and powerful, like the sun. The ever responsible and sharp witted Parot o Scarlett. The enigmatically talented, yet determined Crayn Skilite.

*Grants* "These kids will grow up to be great aulists..."

*Mizu* "You sound like a father or something."

*Grants* "Ghaha, I'm not father material in the least!"

*Mizu* "I wouldn't say that. You'd mae a great father."
