The foster child of the Orgel family, entrusted to them after his parents had to attend an emergency call from the Gardeners. After leaving, no one has seen them since, though no one presumes them dead in the least.

He and his friend, Parot o Scarlett, bare a strong protective instinct over his younger foster siblings, Luka and Maka Orgel.
