Winged Thearians

Notable characteristics: Leaf shaped wings, inexhaustible flight

Once the most abundant of the 4 altered human types on Thear, there are now fewer than about 30 thousand of them left. The most well known places they inhabit are the base of Stereve Mountain and phantasmal city, Exhire.

Their green wings do contain chlorophyll and because of this, they do receive energy from the sun and moon. This excess of energy leads them to grow and mature faster than most other Thearians. They are also known to be physically stronger, faster, and require less external sustenance to survive.
