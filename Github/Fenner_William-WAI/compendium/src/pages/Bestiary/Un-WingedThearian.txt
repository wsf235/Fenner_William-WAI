Winged Thearians

Notable characteristics: A green patch on back

Currently the most abundant of the altered humans on Thear. By all accounts, they are normal humans except for a green patch located on their backs, typically between their shoulder blades. They lack the inexhaustible flight capability of their winged counterparts but the green patch still gives them minor aerial benefits.
