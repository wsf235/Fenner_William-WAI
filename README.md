# The Aul Compendium
## Leading Author: Master Anseen (me)
Built with the purpose of it being used along side my Anomaly Et Cetera novel and game series.

## Built with:
* [Reactjs](https://reactjs.org/)

### Installing
```
git clone https://github.com/wsf235/Fenner_William-WAI.git
```

### Usage
Upon opening up the compendium, the user can search the compendium for various bits of information about the world of "Thear".
Each link is disected and used to retrieve the appropriate text file needed to display the data requested.

#### Note
Due to unforseen planning issues, the project will be rebuilt with new/updated tools at a later date
Possibly without reactjs in the future too.
